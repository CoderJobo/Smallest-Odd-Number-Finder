# Smallest-Odd-Number-Finder
Program to find the smallest odd number in an array

SmallestOddNumberFinder is a class that, when instantiated, creates an object to find the smallest  
odd number in an array of ints.  There are two constructors; one takes an int array and the other 
generates an array of random numbers with the size of the array and the maximum size of the range 
of numbers being provided by the user.

CheckSmallestOddNumberFinder contains a main method which checks the two constructors and the 
getter and printing methods and prints messages to screen to show the findings.

SmallestOddNumberFinderJUnitTest uses JUnit to test the SmallestOddNumberFinder class.
